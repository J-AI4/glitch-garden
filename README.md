# Glitch-Garden
This is supposed to be a deckbuilder game called "Glitch Garden", I kept it simple so there isn't a specific goal (though you can set one yourself if you want!). It's a game for Panda to grow a bamboo "garden" using the cards at the bottom of the screen.

Plant Card - Plant one bamboo tile at a time
Remove Card - Remove one bamboo tile at a time
Super Grow - Plant 3 bamboo tiles at a time
Plus one - Too bad... that's a surprise.

Keys to Move:
Arrow keys - to move Panda
W & S - to move the camera up and down respectively
Left click - to select a card
Space - to perform the action of the selected card
